## OpenGL 2D Drawing Demo ##

![Demo](/Demo.gif?raw=true)

`OpenGL 2D Drawing Demo` shows how to load and render pixels in a `CAOpenGLLayer` using a custom vertex and fragment shader using Open GL 3.2 and GLSL 1.50.

The shaders loading code is adapted from the amazing [Cocoa-GL-Tutorial](https://github.com/beelsebob/Cocoa-GL-Tutorial) and [Cocoa-GL-Tutorial 2](https://github.com/beelsebob/Cocoa-GL-Tutorial-2).
